🎗️ Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning techniques.

Using medical diagnostic features extracted from cell images, the model learns patterns that help distinguish between non-cancerous and cancerous tumors.

This project demonstrates practical skills in:

-  Medical data analysis
  
-  Feature scaling
  
-  Supervised classification
  
-  Model evaluation
